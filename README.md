# Paint Android Application
Developed an MSPaint-like application for Android. In this first stage, drawing on a canvas with customizable brush sizes and colors,alongwith eraser option has been implemented.

# Challenges Overcame
My first Android experience from years ago, it was difficult to find relevant sourcecode from online videos and message boards. An OOP approach is necessary as always, and relevant functions were written and overloaded wherever required. Constructors were also useful for creating multiple paint instances. 

# Test Run
The UI is pretty self-explanatory, The "Color" button switches the brush from Black to Red to Eraser. The top left is the brush pixel size. Below is the test on Pixel 2 emulator.
