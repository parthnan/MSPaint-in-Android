# Paint Android Application
Developed an MSPaint-like application for Android. In this first stage, drawing on a canvas with customizable brush sizes and colors,alongwith eraser option has been implemented.

# Challenges Overcame
My first Android experience from years ago, it was difficult to find relevant sourcecode from online videos and message boards. The logic itself is as simple as it gets though.

# Test Run
The UI is pretty self-explanatory, The "Color" button switches the brush from Black to Red to Eraser. The top left is the brush pixel size. Below is the test on Pixel 2 emulator.
